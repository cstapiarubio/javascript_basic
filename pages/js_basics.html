                <p>JavaScript Basics JavaSmipt is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaSmipt is extremely popular 
                    for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to lake it in
                     a bunch of different directions. SavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node saver), it can he 
                     comusted to the objects of these airdrome. to provide mogrammatic control over 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span> Variable Declaration</span><p>JavaSclipt variables are containers for sexing data values - iniaMne a cup you 
                        fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a amiable holds a value. All SavaScriM variables musthe identifial with 
                        unique names. Theme unique names are called identifiers. vas</p></li>
                    <li><span>Variable Assignment</span><p>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript vadaMes - our cup aim now have coffee mural in 
                        it, giving our variable a value to hold. Tbe w asap.. operator assigns a value to a variable. vas x = 10;</p></li>
                    <li><span>Data Types</span><p>Data types are im important comma to be able to operate on vadables you need to know lbe data type.
                         There are six data Ines that are taxi Script primitives: Boolean - true or false: null- aka nab., Number - 42 or 3.14159; 
                         Stung- "Coding Dojo Road "; Army- [1, "Corting", 2, 'Dojo.]: and Object - {fint_namei lam_name:</p></li>
                    <li><span>Conditionals</span><p>When you "Mite code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - 
                        [kWh, different code blocks bastion valuues or conditions that have been met. You min um conditional statements in your cede to
                         accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is InlaidÂ° this code in our code block; 
                         else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first conditim is false; else we execute this block of rode:</p></li>
                    <li><span>Loops</span><p>are many different kids of loops in every mogramming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an 
                        action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you runaround the track four times and then you stop. Thais a loop,</p></li>
                    <li><span>Functions</span><p>Pureions are im encasmilation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a 
                        list of hmtmctions.
                        As an example imagine we are putting together a de. from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we 
                        screw the legato the table top; next we place the bade the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sally there are a 
                        ton more tables to do so lets mill our function over and over and over again. </p></li>
